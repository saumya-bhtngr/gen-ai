**3. Transformer-Based Sentiment Classification**

   Problem: Develop and evaluate basic and advanced Transformer models for binary text classification to understand the application of attention mechanisms and positional encoding in NLP.
   Dataset Used: IMDB dataset
   Solution:
   * Implement, train, and evaluate two neural network architectures (basic and advanced Transformer models)
   * Loading, pre-processing the IMDB dataset along with EDA
   * Constructing and training basic and advanced transformer models (with custom positional encoding layer)
   * Display Model architecture and visualize training progress
   * Evaluate both models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC
   * Compare their performance on sentiment classification using appropriate metrics.

   Outcome:
   Hands-on experience with modern Transformer architectures applied to customer sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset.
