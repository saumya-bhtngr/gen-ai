**1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering System**

   Problem: Design and implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with conversational memory using generative AI tools.

   Solution:
   * Built a RAG pipeline that combines generative capabilities with real-time access to domain-specific documents
   * Implemented chunking and created embeddings for each chunk
   * Used vector store FAISS and executed semantic search
   * Integrated vector store wth GPT-4 language model and added memory capability

   Outcome:
   Enterprose-ready AI system using conversational memory to enhance context-awareness and continuity.
